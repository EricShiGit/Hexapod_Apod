This code base will support hexapods on the more modern BotBoarduino/SSC-32 platform. Thank you to Kurt (KurtE) for the doing the
initial port from Basic Stamp to Arduino. The gait used for the Apod gait is derived from the phoenix gait. 

Multi-leg Platform: A-Pod 24 DoF Hexapod
Recommended Microcontroller: BotBoarduino
Recommended Servo Controller: SSC-32 Channel Servo Controller
Currently Supported Control Systems:
	- Xbee
	- Lynxmotion PS2 - V3

In order to compile this code in Arduino, you will need to install this library:
